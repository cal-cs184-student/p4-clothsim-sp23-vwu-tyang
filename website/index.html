    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
</a>
<blockquote><b>
    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
    To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.
    You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
    <br />
    <small>
        Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>?
        A high <code>ks</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    While experimenting with the spring constant parameter of the simulation, we noticed that it played a significant role in the elasticity of the cloth during the simulation.  When the spring constant <code> ks </code> was very small (<code>ks = 500</code>), the cloth would warp in the resting position, bowing out in the center and deforming from the starting square shape.  Furthermore, if we look at the two corners where the cloth is pinned, you can see that the corners deform significantly with low <code>ks</code> values, demonstrating the lack of elasticity and stretching,  In a similar vein, increasing the value of <code>ks</code> to be around 5000 led to the cloth falling with minimal elasticity, maintaining a taut straight line at the base in the final resting position.  Likewise, the pinned corners have minimal deformation.  We can also see these effects in the final resting positions of the cloth.  This is due to the fact that the spring constant effectively represents how stiff the spring is, with higher values implying that it is much more restorative, hence less degeneracy.
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    While experimenting with the density parameter of the simulation, we noticed that it played a significant role in the sagging and folding behavior of the cloth during the simulation.  As density increased, we noticed that the cloth would have significant sagging and folding in the center of the cloth in the final resting state.  This is different from the deformation that we see when we have varying ks values. In these simulations, we see folding near the top of the cloth with higher density whereas, with high ks values, there is minimal folding, demonstrating more of the elastic force of the springs.  With low density values, the sagging at the top middle portion of the cloth decreases.  The reason for this is that, with an increased density, the top of the cloth is pulled down more from the lower portions of the cloth.  The elasticity itself does not change with increased density.
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    The damping factor plays a role in how fast the cloth settles into its final resting position.  With a lower damping factor, the convergence of the cloth to its final resting position takes significantly longer, with ripples from the bouncing and the elasticity of the cloth seeing less attenuation.  The cloth continues to oscillate back and forth for much longer and shows significantly more movement.  When the damping factor is high, the cloth settles much faster into its resting position, and movements that ripple through the cloth as it falls are quickly flattened.  When comparing a damping factor of 0% with a damping factor of 100%, it is evident as to the difference it takes for the cloth to converge into it’s resting position due to the sensitivity of the cloth to movement.
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters
        and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

    <b>Implementation Overview: </b>
    <p> For self collision, we can utilize hashmap to check for collisions between nearby voxels. And to construct a
        good hash function for the Vector3D coordinates, we can take model the 3D space on a grid, and put each point
        mass into a discrete cell. This is achieved with floor(pos.x / w). To make sure we minimize hash collisions, we
        designed the following hash function: (fz ^ (fy &lt;&lt; 1)) ^ (fx &lt;&lt; 2); where fx = floor(pos.x / w). We
        did not use fmod() as it appears to slow down simulation.

    <p><b>Density:</b></p>
    <p>
        Increasing the density on clothes increases the overall unit weight for the cloth. Comparing the images above
        from up to bottom, we can see that as density increase, the cloth appears to collide with itself more. As
        density increases the cloth also becomes a lot less bouncy, which causes more frequent self collisions that are
        of smaller magitude.
    </p>

    <p><b>Spring Constant (ks):</b></p>
    <p>
        Increasing the spring constant increases the spring's stiffness. Comparing the images above from left to right,
        we can see that as spring constant increase, the cloth becomes a lot more stiff. With
        a lower ks, the cloth appears to be softer and stretchy. As the cloth becomes stiffer, it also collides harder
        with itself (instead of colliding softly) and is able to quickly reach restful state.

<blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    Shader programs are programs that run on a GPU and is able to create visual elements of 3D scenes. There are mainly two types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders are useful for transforming the vertices of a 3D object into their final positions on the screen. They can also perform other operations, such as texture mapping. Fragment shaders, on the other hand, are responsible for determining the color of each pixel on the screen. They do this by taking into account the lighting and material properties of the object. Together, the two shaders can be used in conjunction (vertex->fragment).
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    The Blinn-Phong Shading model puts together three different components of lights: ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. The ambient component represents the constant amount of light that is present in the environment. The diffuse component represents the light that is scattered in all directions when it hits a rough surface, and is dependent on the angle between the surface normal and the light direction. The specular component represents the light that is reflected in a single direction when it hits a shiny surface, and is dependent on the angle between the view direction and the reflection direction. 
</p>
<p>
    The images below demonstrate each of these contributions independently, and the final image is a weighted sum. By tuning the parameters of each contribution, we can simulate different appearances of different materials.

<p>
    Bump and displacement mapping are pretty similar. From the images above, it is obvious that displacement mapping adds in an additional step of moving (displacing) the vertex positions, whereas Bump mapping only modifes the normals of an object. Since in Bump mapping the texture is directly mapped on the sphere, there is no noticeable change in vertex positions of the object. In contrast, displacement mapping changes vertex positions to the height map and changes normals to stay consistent with the new vertex positions. Displacement mapping looks more edgy in comparison since the surface is actually being modified.
