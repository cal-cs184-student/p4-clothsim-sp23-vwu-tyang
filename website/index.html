    <b>Implementation Overview: </b>
    <p> For self collision, we can utilize hashmap to check for collisions between nearby voxels. And to construct a
        good hash function for the Vector3D coordinates, we can take model the 3D space on a grid, and put each point
        mass into a discrete cell. This is achieved with floor(pos.x / w). To make sure we minimize hash collisions, we
        designed the following hash function: (fz ^ (fy &lt;&lt; 1)) ^ (fx &lt;&lt; 2); where fx = floor(pos.x / w). We
        did not use fmod() as it appears to slow down simulation.

    <p><b>Density:</b></p>
    <p>
        Increasing the density on clothes increases the overall unit weight for the cloth. Comparing the images above
        from up to bottom, we can see that as density increase, the cloth appears to collide with itself more. As
        density increases the cloth also becomes a lot less bouncy, which causes more frequent self collisions that are
        of smaller magitude.
    </p>

    <p><b>Spring Constant (ks):</b></p>
    <p>
        Increasing the spring constant increases the spring's stiffness. Comparing the images above from left to right,
        we can see that as spring constant increase, the cloth becomes a lot more stiff. With
        a lower ks, the cloth appears to be softer and stretchy. As the cloth becomes stiffer, it also collides harder
        with itself (instead of colliding softly) and is able to quickly reach restful state.
